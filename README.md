# Linux
This repo will be based on little things that refresh my memory in the Linux environment.  
We can call this an extension of my memory so to speak, so that I have space available for new things that i learn. 
We can look at this as cache of sorts.  
If you stumble across it, then I hope there is something here that will help your technical journey.
